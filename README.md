## Self-Learning Guessing Game

This game uses binary trees to guess what the animal you have chosen is.
Every time it guesses the wrong animal, you teach it something, and it
remembers that fact for the next round.

Created for Spring 2024 - Data Stuctures & Algorithms with Prof. Morris at UT Tyler.
